  <p>
    Hello, my name is Gustavo Puma and I'm a software developer, currently working as a Lecturer in Arequipa, Peru.
    If you're a potential employer, please check the menu above for information about my work experience, education and projects.
    If you're on mobile, click the hamburger icon to see the menu.

    My main interests are programming, education, linguistics and videogames. I'm also mildly interested in too many other topics to mention :).
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm fluent in both Spanish and English. I lived in Australia for almost 2 years, while studying a Masters Degree,
    and had some of the best experiences of my life over there. The picture below was actually taken at the Three Sisters in Sydney. Great place!

    Currently, this website is only working as my online CV. Coming next: blog posts. Stay tuned!
